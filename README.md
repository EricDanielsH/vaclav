# Web developer task

This is a simple website for the Web developer position.

## Getting Started

### Online version

I took the time to deploy the website! You can check it out [here](https://vaclav.vercel.app).

### Running Locally

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Easy!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see website.
